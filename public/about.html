<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, my name is Alejandro Cardenas. I’m originally from Los Cabos, Baja California Sur, and I’ve been living in Querétaro for over three years. I moved here to pursue my degree in Software Engineering at Anáhuac University, motivated by my technical high school background focused on programming. Querétaro’s growing tech industry made it the perfect place to continue developing my skills and preparing for a career in software development.</p>

<p>I'm currently in my seventh semester and working at GE Aerospace. This portfolio is a way for me to showcase the knowledge I've gained so far in technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. My goal is to demonstrate that I’m ready to take on more responsibility and earn a software engineering role within GE Aerospace or in the wider tech industry.</p>

<p>Outside of work and studies, I’m passionate about fitness. I enjoy lifting weights and going to the gym — a habit I started with my father back in Los Cabos. Although I now live in Querétaro with my aunt and grandfather, I still try to keep that routine going. I’m also an avid gamer and often play Call of Duty: Warzone online with a close friend from high school. Another interest of mine is language learning — I’ve been studying Japanese and hope to continue soon when my schedule allows.</p>

<p>I’m someone who’s always open to learning and growing. Whether it's in a classroom, at work, or through new personal challenges, I’m ready to step up and keep pushing forward.</p>
